#Operation Irongeek

#opirongeek

Facts:
On Thursday June 5 it was learned that Google has suspended the YouTube account of Adrian Crenshawï»¿, also known as Irongeek, who travels to conferences across the country to video presentations at hacker conferences for educational purposes. He does this at his own expense as a service of the community. It appears that Google suspended this account for TOS reasons that are based on the subject of his videos. 

Censorship:
This is direct censorship of hacking content by Google. This cannot stand. It is an affront to free speech. 

Call to Action:
We ask that all members of the information security community join us in urging Google to restore Irongeek account. 

The hastag for this op is #opirongeek. Please use the hashtag when Tweeting about this issue. We ask that you use social media to spread the word about this attack on free speech.
