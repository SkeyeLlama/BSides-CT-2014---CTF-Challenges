This repository contains the four challenges I submitted for the BSides CT 2014 CTF.

Challenge 1: Echo Tool
	
	This is a web challenge built in PHP. The goal is to gain access to the 
	administrator account, which will provide the key. Unzip the included 
	files to the /chal1/ directory off the root of your web server and it 
	should be good to go.

Challenge 2: PasteGin

	This is a web challenge built in PHP. The goal is to reveal the secret 
	key containing file on the web server and then retrieve its contents. 
	Unzip the included files to the /chal2/ directory off the root of your 
	web server and it should be good to go.

Challenge 3: USB Slurper

	This is a forensics challenge. An employee is suspected of exfiltrating 
	industrial secrets. Find out what he is taking to find the key. A copy of 
	his USB drive was made while he was at lunch and is provided.

Challenge 4: Cryptovirus

	This is a crypto/network forensics challenge. Included in the archive are 
	an email explaining the challenge, some encrypted files and a network
